# Java Script TODO list. No frameworks, or external libraries are used. Built with a Parcel. 

Please see deployed app here https://stanislavsukhanov.github.io/ciklum-university-js-band-internship/

This repo has been reinitialized because gh pages has not displayed updates in a second build (fixed styles and minor updates in logic). 
Main logic has been implemened within mentioned deadline, but i've spent some time to figure out how to deploy it gh-pages. The reason - it's been initially completed in a codesandbox environment. 
Hope it won't be an issue. 
Looking forweard to joining you :)
